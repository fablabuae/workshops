## Description
Francisco is an Spanish Civil Engineer founder of The (fabulous) Beach Lab. Ahmed Galal an Egyptian Telecommunications Engineer working in FabLab UAE in Dubai. In a collaborative exploration between both labs, we will join our passions for computational design, open source software and geometry in a fascinating journey into generative design of Islamic Geometric Patterns.

In Islamic culture, geometric design is everywhere: you can find it in mosques, madrasas, palaces, and private homes. And despite the complexity of these designs, they can be created with just a compass and a ruler. In this workshop you will discover how patterns of profound beauty and subtle complexity can be created from the simplest computational generative techniques by using freely available, multi platform, open source software.
